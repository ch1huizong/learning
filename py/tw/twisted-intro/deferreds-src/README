The source in this directory was used as examples in the talk Deferred
Gratification by Terry Jones on July 21, 2010 at EuroPython, in Birmingham.

Some of the code:

  deferredLock.py
  deferredQueue.py
  succeed.py

is simplified versions of what can be found in
twisted/internet/defer.py in the Twisted distribution, and is intended only
to illustrate certain aspects (simplicity, beauty) of Twisted.

Other files:

  deferredPooler.py
  deferredPoolerExample.py
  deferredPoolerTest.py
  rdq.py
  retryingCall.py
  tee.py

contain code used in production by Fluidinfo Inc., in part in their FluidDB
product (http://fluidinfo.com), and in part in Tickery (running at
http://tickery.net with source at http://github.com/fluidinfo/Tickery).
